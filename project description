First, we're really sorry that we missed the deadline.

Secondly, our idea is to use the VÃ¤sttrafik API to make a simple application for getting upcoming departures from a bus-stop. The user will simply search for a bus-stop or choose a favorite bus-stop, and the program will show a departure table. This would mean that we'd have to do make use of the internet to be able to use the API, but also write some JSON parsing to get the results from the API call. It could also include some more functionality to make it possible for the user to send more parameters, and thus create more complicated API calls.
